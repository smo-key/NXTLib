#####LEGO NXT API for Windows

The purpose of this library is to code a solution for **live control** of the brick from a Windows device and to make the programming process simpler for NXT targeting on Windows.

###Features

- Easy to code, easy to use, easy to share
- Hooks into any Windows app via C++, C#, or Visual Basic
- Two file upload demos to get you started

###What You Can Do

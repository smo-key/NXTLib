/// This software was created using Visual Studio 2008 Standard Edition with .NET Framework 2.0.
/// 
/// Purpose: 
/// Demonstrates USB communications using the Microsoft WinUSB driver.
/// 
/// Requirements:
/// Windows XP or later and an attached USB device that uses the WinUSB driver.
/// 
/// Description:
/// Finds an attached device whose INF file contains a specific device interface GUID.
/// Enables sending and receiving data via bulk, interrupt, and control transfers.
/// 
/// Uses RegisterDeviceNotification() and WM_DEVICE_CHANGE messages
/// to detect when a device is attached or removed.
/// 
/// For bulk and interrupt transfers, the application uses a Delegate and the BeginInvoke 
/// and EndInvoke methods to read data asynchronously, so the application's main thread 
/// doesn't have to wait for the device to return data. A callback routine uses 
/// marshaling to send data to the form, whose code runs in a different thread. 
///  
/// This software, an example INF file, and companion device firmware are available from 
/// www.Lvr.com
/// 
/// Send comments, bug reports, etc. to jan@Lvr.com 
/// This application has been tested under Windows XP and Windows Vista.
